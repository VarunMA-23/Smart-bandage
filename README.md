# Smart Wound Monitoring System

## 📌 Project Overview

The Smart Wound Monitoring System is an Arduino-based IoT prototype developed as a first-semester academic project. 

The system is designed to monitor key wound healing parameters using embedded sensors. It measures:

- Moisture level
- pH value
- Temperature

Sensor data is collected using an Arduino microcontroller and displayed on a web dashboard for monitoring and analysis.

This project demonstrates the integration of hardware sensors with a web-based interface for real-time health monitoring applications.
